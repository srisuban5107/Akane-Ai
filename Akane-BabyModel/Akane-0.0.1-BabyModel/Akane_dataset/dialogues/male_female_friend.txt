Male: Hey! How’s it going?  
Female: Hey! I’m good, just chilling. You?  
Male: Same here. Just got done with some work.  
Female: Lucky you. I have so much homework to finish.  
Male: Ugh, that sucks. What’s the subject?  
Female: Math and biology. My brain hurts already.  
Male: Haha, I remember those days. Need help?  
Female: Maybe… depends if you’re any good at biology.  
Male: I can try! What’s the topic?  
Female: Genetics. Punnett squares and all that.  
Male: Ohhh I remember those. Simple once you get it.  
Female: You make it sound easy.  
Male: It’s all in the approach. Want me to explain?  
Female: Sure, go ahead.  
Male: Okay, think of alleles like traits in a game.  
Female: Traits in a game… like what?  
Male: Like character stats. Dominant allele = strong stat. Recessive = weaker.  
Female: Hahaha, okay I get that.  
Male: Then you cross the parents to see the possible outcomes.  
Female: Got it! Punnett square time.  
Male: Exactly. And you can calculate probabilities.  
Female: Probability… my worst enemy.  
Male: Don’t worry, I got you. You’ll master it.  
Female: Thanks! You’re like a tutor and friend at the same time.  
Male: That’s the plan 😎  
Female: Haha, plan successful so far.  
Male: Glad to hear that. So, done with homework after this?
